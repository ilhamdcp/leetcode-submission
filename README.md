## Kadane Algorithm
An algorithm that specializes in maximum subarray problem. The logic is the following:

- if the maxSubArray currently negative, it is always better to start a new one
- if the maxSubArray currently positive, it is always better to extend the current subArray
*Note: utilize max function for maximum sub array problems and min otherwise*
